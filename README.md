## Installing

### Environment Variable
`.env`
```
ADASMS_APPLICATION_SECRET=<your-adasms-application-secret>
```

### Package Manager

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm install adasms-client
```

Using bower:

```bash
$ bower install adasms-client
```

Using yarn:

```bash
$ yarn add adasms-client
```

Using pnpm:

```bash
$ pnpm add adasms-client
```

Once the package is installed, you can import the library using `import` or `require` approach:

```js
import { Client } from 'adasms-client';
```

You can also use the default export, since the named export is just a re-export from the adasms-client factory:

```js
import Client from 'adasms-client';
````

If you use `require` for importing, **only default export is available**:

```js
const adasms = require('adasms-client');
```
